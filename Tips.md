### Convention 
- All test files should start with ```test_```
	- also the file inside

    	|:----|:----|
    	| *function* | ```test_``` |
    	| *class* | ```Test``` |
    	| *method* | ```test_``` |
	
- There should be a ```__init__.py``` file inside the test folder


### TDD with *pytest*
- What is it?
    - write the tests first
    - failed as you expected
    - write the code to make them pass
    - ...
    - Then repeating it 
- Advantages?
	- It forces you to ***think the problem first***
